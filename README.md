# Process

I began researching React, Apollo, VX, following some of their starter guides to give me an idea of how to get setup and start building with them.

I then started creating a rough design of how I wanted the page to look and function. Decided on a simple user profile using cards. Felt this would keep it flexible depending on the amount of work I could get done in the time given.

I outlined the page and created a card component to place much of the individual pieces of content inside.

Started the visualisations with a chord diagram and realsied I would need to build up a incidence matrix of the topics. Manipulating the data in this way was difficult, and I felt the library could have offered up other ways to take the data. The word cloud and bar chart were considerably easier to provide data too.

I finished up by using Reacts state management to allow the user to be changed.

I enjoyed working with React, but was unsure of best practices. Coming from an Angular background I am used to knowing the "Angular" way of doing things. I see this as both a pro and a con of React; you are free to go your own way, but success very much depends on your skill and experience in the React space. I would be interested to see what a large scale React app would look like.

I found VX's documentation quite light, really only telling you what was available and what properties each thing had. For this reason I stuck to alterations of their examples, but given more time I would have liked to have crafted something more tailored. I would have also included more labels, tooltips and legends, as it is not very self explanatory in its current state.

I spent relatively little of the time on styling as I wanted to focus on the visualisations. I ideally would have split the App component up a bit more too.

Graphql was an interesting to use, but seeing no way to filter the data in the request hampered me. A way to filter posts by the user would have been very useful.

Overall, I enjoyed working on the app and would use these technologies again.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
